Maker (seller) and taker (buyer) fees are configurable. Each can be a flat amount or a percent. Set to zero to disable. Configure in Admin > Marketplace.

## Tiers

- **Starter** — 5 collections, 4 base currencies
- **Growth** — 50 collections, 4 base currencies, 1 custom currency
- **Pro** — 250 collections, 4 base currencies, 2 custom currencies, monetize storefront

**Monetize storefront** (Pro) lets you take a cut of sales via shop fees. Add-ons include extra mints and custom currency. See [Billing](/docs/general/billing-overview).
