# Collections and currencies

## Collections

Add collection mint addresses in Admin > Marketplace. Each collection expands into individual NFTs. Members can list and buy any NFT from an enabled collection. Tier limits cap how many collections you can add (Starter: 5, Growth: 50, Pro: 250).

## Currencies

The storefront supports base currencies (SOL, USDC, etc.) and optional custom tokens. Base currencies are fixed per tier. Custom currencies require Growth or Pro. Configure in Admin > Marketplace.
