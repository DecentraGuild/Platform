# Domains and slugs

## Subdomains

Each dGuild is served on a subdomain in the form `{slug}.dguild.org`. The **slug** is the identifier in the URL. New dGuilds use an ID-based URL by default.

## Custom slug

The **Custom slug** add-on lets you claim a memorable subdomain (e.g. `skull.dguild.org`). Slugs must be unique. Check availability in Admin and claim. The add-on is billed yearly. See [Billing](/docs/general/billing-overview).
