# Admin

Admin is where you configure your dGuild: branding, modules, and settings. Access it from your dGuild’s Admin page.

## Tabs

- **General** — Name, description, logo, Discord invite
- **Domains and slugs** — Subdomain and custom slug (see [Domains and slugs](/docs/modules/admin/domains-and-slugs))
- **Theming** — Colours and visual identity
- **Modules** — Enable or disable Market, Discord
- **Marketplace** — Collections, currencies, fees (when Market is enabled)
- **Discord** — Server link, role rules (when Discord is enabled)
- **Billing** — Subscription status and costs

## General

Name, description, logo, and Discord invite. These appear in the directory and across your dGuild.

## Theming

Set your primary and secondary colours. Changes apply across your dGuild.

## Modules

Turn modules on or off. Only enabled modules appear in the nav. Disabling a module hides it and stops its features.

## Billing

Shows your subscription, current period, and what you are billed. Use it to renew or change plans.
