# Directory

## Discovering dGuilds

The Directory lists all dGuilds on the platform. Each card shows name, description, and logo. Use it to explore communities and find ones you want to join.

## Visiting a dGuild

Click **Visit** to open a dGuild. You land on its subdomain (e.g. `skull.dguild.org`) with that dGuild’s branding and modules. If Market is enabled, you can browse and trade. If Discord is enabled, members can link wallets and get roles. Admin is available only to dGuild admins.
