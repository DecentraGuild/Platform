# Getting started

## What is DecentraGuild

DecentraGuild provides Web3 infrastructure and a ready-made UI so communities can run their own hub: storefront, Discord integration, branding, and treasury. You build it; we power it.

## What is a dGuild Custom

A **dGuild Custom** is your organisation on the platform. (We often shorten this to "dGuild.") Custom means: we supply the technology and interface; you choose the modules, flows, and rules. DecentraGuild does not hold custody or control over your dGuild environment, now or in the future. You own and operate it.

Your dGuild has:

- Branding (logo, colours, theme)
- A dedicated subdomain (e.g. `skull.dguild.org`)
- Modules you enable (Market, Discord, Admin)
- Your treasury and fee settings
- Admin access

Members use your subdomain to interact with your dGuild. You decide which modules are active.

## Build Your Own

The offering is **Build Your Own**: choose which modules to enable, set your branding, and run your community on-chain. DecentraGuild handles the infrastructure; you control what happens inside your dGuild.

## Quick start

1. **Create** — Connect your wallet, pay the registration fee, and set up your org.
2. **Configure** — Use Admin to enable modules, set branding, and configure Market or Discord.
3. **Operate** — Your community trades on the storefront and links wallets for Discord roles.
4. **Grow** — Add modules and adjust tiers as you scale.

See [Creating a dGuild](/docs/general/creating-a-dguild) for the step-by-step flow.
