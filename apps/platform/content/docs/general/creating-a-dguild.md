# Creating a dGuild

## Connect wallet

Go to the [Create org](/onboard) page and connect your wallet. Phantom, Solflare, and other Solana-compatible wallets are supported. You sign a message to verify your identity.

## Fill details

- **Name** (required)
- **Description** (required)
- **Logo** (required) — URL to your logo image
- **Discord invite** (optional)

These can be updated later in Admin.

## Pay registration

Registration requires a one-time USDC payment. The amount is shown before you confirm. Ensure you have enough USDC and SOL for fees. Sign the transaction to complete.

## After creation

You are redirected to your dGuild Admin, where you can enable modules, set branding, configure Market or Discord, and manage billing.
