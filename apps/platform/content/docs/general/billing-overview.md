# Billing

## Overview

Pricing has three parts:

- **Registration** — One-time USDC payment when you create your dGuild
- **Module tiers** — Monthly or yearly fees per enabled module (Market, Discord)
- **Add-ons** — Extra capacity on top of base tiers (custom slug, additional mints)

All payments are in USDC, on-chain.

## Registration fee

A one-time payment when you create your dGuild. Covers provisioning your organisation.

## Module tiers

Market and Discord use tiered pricing: Starter, Growth, Pro. Each tier has limits (collections, role rules, mints). Higher tiers add capacity and features. You choose a tier when you enable the module. The Admin pricing widget shows the cost.

## Add-ons

- **Custom slug** — Claim a memorable subdomain (e.g. `skull.dguild.org`). Billed yearly.
- **Extra mints** — Additional collections or role rules beyond the tier limit.

Configure add-ons in Admin. The pricing widget displays all costs.

## Yearly discount

Many modules offer a discount for yearly billing. The discount is shown in the pricing widget.
t is shown in the pricing widget.
