# How it works

## Listing

A seller connects their wallet, selects an NFT or SPL asset, sets a price, and creates a listing. The asset moves to escrow.

## Browsing

Buyers browse by collection or asset type. Filters and search narrow results.

## Purchase

A buyer selects a listing and pays the price (plus taker fee). The buyer receives the asset; the seller receives funds (minus maker fee). The escrow program settles on-chain.

## Trade management

Sellers can cancel listings. Both sides view open trades in My Trades.
