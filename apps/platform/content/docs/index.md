# Documentation

Build your dGuild. Run your community.

DecentraGuild is Web3 infrastructure as a service. You use our tech and UI to create a dGuild Custom: your organisation with your branding, treasury, and modules. Your community gets a dedicated hub tailored to your setup. We provide the infrastructure; you own and operate your dGuild. DecentraGuild does not hold custody or control over your environment, now or in the future.
