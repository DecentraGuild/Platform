# Contracts package

Solana programs (e.g. Anchor) and IDLs.

- Platform contract (tenant id + config) when we move on-chain.
- Module-specific programs if they live in this repo (e.g. raffle, marketplace). Otherwise IDLs and program IDs for external programs.
- Build and deploy scripts; versioned IDLs for the frontend.
